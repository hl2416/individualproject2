		 The Bronx Zoo is a zoo located in central Bronx. It is one of the largest zoos in the United States and has a multitude of exhibits which may cost extra. Upon entering through the
		 main entrance, there are maps and an area for souvenirs as well as food. With the map, people can choose to go see what they want by taking a path that leads them to the animals
		 shown on the map. It is somewhat of a hike but there may be refreshments on the paths. Some of the animals are out in the open just behind some fences while others are in cages.
		 While most exhibits are inside buildings, there are also non-exhibit buildings which can be entered free of any extra charges so you should watch for signs.

		 The Bronx Zoo was the one area or attraction that I had visited many times, either as a school trip or with family. I remembered entering and one fo the first animals I saw was an
		 ostrich or some other animal giving kids a ride on the saddle on its back. It was not a horse or anything similar but it left a bit of an impression as I still kind of remember it
		 years later. The maps people could pick up were paper and showed the exact same thing as the stationary maps placed in certain areas. One of the exhibits that I remembered was the
		 monorail, an exhibit I never actually went on near the entrance. The zoo was large and we would occasionally get lost or tired from the hike to see all the animals. It was
		 definitely not the most relaxing walk I have had but it was exciting in its own way. If you plan on seeing all the animals, at least the animals not in the exhibits, it would still
		 take you a day so plan your time when going there. Other than that, you can enjoy seeing some exotic animals if that is your interest.
