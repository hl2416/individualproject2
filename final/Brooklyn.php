		 Brooklyn is the borough that connects the other boroughs. Located in the middle between the boroughs, it is connected to Manhattan via multiple underground tunnels as well as
		 bridges such as the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridge across the East River. The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge connects it to Staten Island. Being the most populous of the 5 boroughs, it
		 is a major residential area and my current home.

		 Despite having lived longer in Brooklyn, I know more about Manhattan mainly because I spent more time outside when I was younger. This may also be because Manhattan has more famous
		 landmarks such as the Empire State Building and Central Park which I have seen a lot of. Compared to my time in Brooklyn, I mostly see houses or apartments and there just seems to
		 be less energy than Manhattan. During daytime, when I look out my window, there is usually just a few people walking around with the occasional car passing by. The residential areas
		 are very peaceful and even the areas with a multitude of shops have less energy than that of Manhattan. Most of the buildings around are also pretty short compared to those in
		 Manhattan. This is for the residential areas that I have been to. This does not mean there are no areas in Brooklyn with similar energy to that of Manhattan so you should head out
		 to see for yourself.
