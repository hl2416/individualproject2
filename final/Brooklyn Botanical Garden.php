		 The Brooklyn Botanic(al) Garden is a botanical garden in Mount Prospect Park which is next to Prospect Park and located in Central Brooklyn. It has a variety of plants from
		 different environments such as Cherry trees and cactuses. Each garden tends to have a certain theme such as the japanese garden with cherry trees, rose gardens, and aquatic gardens.
		 Apart from the plants, they also have events such as festivals and marriages, some of which are held in the Palm House to the right. There are also times where you can enter for
		 free although you still won't have access to some of their exhibits.

		 I have been to the Brooklyn Botanical Garden a few times before although I did not really pay much attention there. It is a good place to go on a relaxing walk provided the weather
		 is right. In the summer, when it is sweltering, it is definitely not a relaxing place to go to. Unlike Central Park, there is actually not much shade except for the buildings and
		 some of the buildings are actually even hotter for certain plants. A lot of the plants are also in outside gardens so you would be missing out if you just stay inside. Other than
		 that, if you enjoy looking at different plants, seeing some of the garden's architecture, or are curious about the events, it is a pretty good place to go.
