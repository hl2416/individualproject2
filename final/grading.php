			 Good Design Techniques (CRAP) - My website has contrast between the lighter and darker colors such as the darker blue in the sides contrasting with the white of the page and the
			 color of the letters contrasting with the background color. Each page has the same navigation bar and color as well as picture and text alignment. The text that fits with the
			 pictures are placed together appropriately.
		 </li>
		 <li class="ref2">
			 Organization of Information - The content is organized based off the boroughs where they are in or associated with. The titles tell exactly what the page will be talking about.
			 The images associated with that location is placed properly so that it can help with what the page is saying.
		 </li>
		 <li class="ref2">
			 Content - I attempted to provide a bit of insight to some of the places I have been to or experienced before. Even if I did not actually experience it, I try to provide as much
			 information as I can from what I remember being near it.
		 </li>
		 <li class="ref2">
			 Navigation - The navigation menu is the same on all pages and are separated into boroughs so that the attractions are closer together.
		 </li>
		 <li class="ref2">
			 HTML5 and CSS3 - Each page has its own html and uses the same css from styles.css in the assets/css folder.
		 </li>
		 <li class="ref2">
			 Reference Page - The reference page is located in the same area as this grading page in the others tab.
		 </li>
		 <li class="ref2">
			 Original Javascript Component - I'm not sure if you can call it one but my hamburger menu uses element.style.display to display and not display the menu in mobile. Theres also an
			 event listener for window so it could redisplay the web menu if it is set to none because of the function above in style.js.
		 </li>
		 <li class="ref2">
			 Extras: Tried to make it somewhat responsive.
