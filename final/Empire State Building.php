		 The Empire State Building is a building located in the middle of lower Manhattan. It has the same nickname as New York which is known as the Empire State. It was the world's tallest
		 building to the tip of its antenna until the first world trade center was built and was again the tallest in the city after it fell until it was rebuilt again. To get in, you would
		 only need to purchase a ticket, then you are free to climb and view the exhibitions they have inside. At the top, you can get a pretty good view of Manhattan in their observatories
		 which has stationary binoculars.

		 The Empire State Building is another place I have not entered but been around, mainly because my previous home was close to it. The information above was pieced together from the
		 bits that popped up in my head. When close to the building, there are quite a few people on the streets holding signs about tours up the building along with souvenir stores full of
		 miniature models of the Statue of Liberty and the Empire State Building. Back then, I always wondered what exactly I would find in there. It was one of the buildings I knew was not
		 a residential building with all the tour signs up and I just could not figure out what was interesting inside a old building like that. To this day, I still have not gone up
		 because the art exhibits and history does not interest me. But maybe you would find the experience worth it.
