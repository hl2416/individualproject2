		 The Brooklyn Bridge is a suspension bridge that streches across the East River between Manhattan and Brooklyn. It is one of the ways to get from Manhattan to Brooklyn and vice versa.
		 There is a platform above the main road where people can walk on and enjoy the view over East River. The main road is, however, only for cars and has two lanes with steel beams
		 separating them. The lanes are for traffic in different directions: to Manhattan and to Brooklyn. Atop the two arches sits an American flag that can be seen from the distance.

		 I have been to the Brooklyn Bridge a few times but only as a passenger in a vehicle. I have unfortunately never been on the top platform as we would only go near the bridge when
		 we need to travel somewhere and it is still kind of far from my home. But whenever I cross the bridge, I can instantly recognize it from the color of its structure and beam
		 placements. Quite close to it is another bridge called the Manhattan Bridge. It is also a suspension bridge and was my primary way of getting to Brooklyn when I lived in Manhattan.
		 It differs from the Brooklyn Bridge in color with it being blue and it does not have a platform above for people to walk on. Instead, there are two small lanes at the sides of the
		 where you can see people walking, jogging, or cycling on everyday. The innermost lane is for vehicles and the lanes in between it and the pedestrian lane are for the subway. I used
		 to take that subway across to Brooklyn and back when needed. It is also mostly made of steel compared to the Brooklyn Bridge. The Brooklyn Bridge is also in the logo of Brooklyn
		 Technical High School which was my high school.
